*a developer blessing for [@thatbudakguy](https://twitter.com/thatbudakguy),  
whose contributions are far beyond mere lines of code*

May the roadmap always stretch out before you,  
May successful projects always be at your back.  
May your completed features be many and your failing unit tests be few.  

May your contributions always outnumber mere lines of code.  
May the servers spin steadily for your apps,  
And deprecations fall softly on your old work,  
And until we pair program again,   
May GitHub hold your revisions in their arctic vault.
