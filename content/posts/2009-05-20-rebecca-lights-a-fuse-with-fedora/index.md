Kyle sends news from the Open Repositories Conference:

>Tonight, Rebecca Sutton Koeser won a runner up award in the [Open Repositories 2009 Developer's Challenge](https://or09.library.gatech.edu/challenge.php) for Fedora-fs, a utility she developed that allows Fedora repository digital objects to appear outwardly, at the application layer, as if they were stored on a simple file system rather than being accessed through API calls.   Rebecca created an end-user oriented screencast during the competition the competition this week that more completely explains her creation and its benefits.
>The award is all expenses paid ($2000) trip to a developer event of her choice.

A big congratulations to Rebecca!
