*This homage to [W. S. Merwin's "Separation"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/28891/separation-56d21285b2140) was originally posted to Twitter in 2019. Reposting to honor and recognize the many wonderful project managers I've had the privilege to work with, past and present, and in memory of Rebecca Munson.*
