I just happened to notice this because I was looking at Google Analytics and saw a huge spike in traffic for one record. Analytics told me most of the traffic came from slate.com but not where exactly; I finally found the article by doing a link search on the ARK url for the ETD ( link:http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/1bb6k ).

Here's the article: [Health Reform and "Massive Resistance"](http://www.slate.com/id/2247580/)

A few paragraphs in, there is a link to [James J. Kilpatrick: The Changing Views of a Southern Newspaper
Editor on School Desegregation](http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/1bb6k) by Lisa Patterson Spees.

It would be pretty cool if we could add a feature that would identify and link back to citations like this... I really only found out about it by accident.
