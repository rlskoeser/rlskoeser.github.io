## Personal stories of interdisciplinary collaboration and the impacts it has on the lives of the collaborators

[Erik Loyer](http://www.erikloyer.com) @opertoon

Digital Humanities projects aren't always best measured in terms of citations or scholarly impact
but rather by the way they impact peoples' lives.  Went back to
former collaborators to find out how these projects had an impact
on their careers and lives.

Tools, standards, infrastructure are important. But greatest impact is
empowering people to take a new approach, perhaps because of an experience,
whether it was successful or not.

[**Vectors**](http://vectors.usc.edu/).  Co-creative director. Team came into contact with a range of
scholarly collaborators.  Fellowship model; brought people in for a boot camp.
Intense collaborations that lasted 6 months or more.

After a while, discovered similarities in the process.  A "crisis moment": destabilization, breakdown
in trying to adapt scholarly work into the digital.  A marker of progress.
Another moment, when a scholar could see their data reflected in the interface.
Many projects encountered a "recuperation of linearity" - discovered linearity
works for a reason and was valid to use.

Design decisions on every level had a rhetorical foundation.  Database design,
shape of the interaction interface.  Experimented with audible forms to
come up with nonverbal markers.

New project: open source library [Stepwise](https://github.com/eloyer/stepwise)
and project [Stepworks](http://step.works/) for rhythmic story telling.
One-click action: "next".   Author controls *what*, user controls *when*.
Performative, easy to create.

Loyer finished by screening/performing a rough cut of a Stepwise piece entitled "Planet Better World",
which was made up of audio from interviews with collaborators and artifacts and
visuals from Vectors projects and other follow-on work.
