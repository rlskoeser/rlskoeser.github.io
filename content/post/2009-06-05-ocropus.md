I came across this at the OpenRepositories2009 poster session-- I hadn't heard of it before, and I thought it was interesting and possibly useful.

[OCRopus](http://sites.google.com/site/ocropus/) is a new(ish) open source OCR tool partially funded by Google. It is meant to be pluggable and modular, so you can use different tools and languages. It's currently only at a 0.4 alpha release, but it may be something worth keeping an eye on.
